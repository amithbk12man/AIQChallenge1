# AIQChallenge1

Suppose we want to show a map to visualize the annual net generation of power plants of the US.
The challenge consists of the following requirements:
· We want to display the top N plants.
· On the map we want to show absolute value and percentage of the plant's federal state.
· We want to be able to filter by state so we can zoom in.
· The data usually comes as excel file - https://www.epa.gov/energy/emissions-generation-resourceintegrated-
database-egrid (eGRID2016 Data File)
· Built JUST a python backend that backs this map with a REST API.
· Bonus: deployment of the solution in a cloud service.
